An ATX-compatible Power Supply Unit (PSU). An AGP graphics card A microSD card, USB flash drive or SATA SSD or hard drive Q: What's the performance of this system like? \u00b6 A: The Vortex86EX CPU can be clocked from 60-500 MHz, and has L1 and L2 caches that can be turned on and off. At 500 MHz with caches enabled, the CPU is roughly comparable in speed to an Intel Pentium 233 MMX. At 60 MHz with caches disabled, it's performing similarly to a 386. Q: Can I use an AGP riser to mount AGP graphics cards into modern compact ITX cases? \u00b6 A: At this time, it is recommended that risers and 90-degree adapters be avoided until further testing has been done. AGP has very strict timing tolerances that likely means most adapters might not work reliably. Plan to use low-profile AGP cards if small cases are desired. Several members in Discord have had success using short (under 1.5 inches) risers, both the flexible shielded cable and PCB design. Q: Does the ITX-Llama support adding a PicoGUS (or other ISA peripherals)? \u00b6 A: Unfortunately no. The Vortex86EX has a stripped-down ISA interface with only a single DMA channel. This is being used by the Crystal sound chip. Additionally, the PicoGUS is strictly a DOS sound card and has no Windows 98 support at this time. Q: Can I connect an Optical drive? \u00b6 A: Yes. You can either use a SATA Optical drive connected to the onboard SATA port or an IDE to SATA adapter paired with an IDE Optical drive. IDE Optical drives typically have audio output which can be connected to the onboard Crystal sound card. (See Accessories for more information.) Q: What kind of PSU should I use? \u00b6 A: Any kind will work! The board and CPU uses very little power, only a few watts. The AGP card can draw a little more, but the overall system power consumption will still be comfortably lower than what every modern PSU can deliver. PicoPSUs of at least 80W can be used for saving space inside your case. Q: Should the Vortex86EX SOM be actively cooled? \u00b6 A: It probably won't have to be, if you have some air flow through the case. If you want to overclock the CPU or have limited air flow, a fan can be mounted above the SOM using the 4 holes around the SOM pin headers on the motherboard. There are also 3 independently controllable (through the BIOS settings menu) fan pin headers on the board. These follow the standard 4-pin PWM fan specification, and can be set to provide 5V or 12V by jumper. (See Jumpers for more information.) Q: What kind of ethernet controller is used? \u00b6 A: There's a built-in RDC R6040 Fast Ethernet (10/100Mbit) controller on the Vortex86EX. This controller has drivers both for DOS and Windows 98. Q: What kind of USB standard is supported? \u00b6 A: The two connectors below the Ethernet port are USB 2.0. With a flash drive plugged in, they can either be used as fixed disks in DOS and Windows (appearing to the operating systems as regular hard drives) or as removable storage. This is configured in the BIOS setting menu. Additionally, there are two USB HID-only ports you can use to connect modern USB keyboards and mice. The HID protocol is translated into PS/2 using an RP2040 chip on the motherboard, and the connected devices appear as regular PS/2 input devices to the operating system. Q: What kind of serial communication does the board offer? \u00b6 A: There are two high-speed UARTs on the board. The first (COM1) uses a standard DE-9M connector on the back side, has a proper high-voltage (+/- 12V) RS-232 transceiver for reliable signalling and is good for at least 115200 baud speeds. It has all the 8 signal lines available. The other UART (COM2) only has data lines (RX/TX), uses TTL logic-level (5V) and is connected to the ESP8266 module and an internal pin header. This can be run at anywhere up to 3 Mbps. Q: What's the deal with the ESP8266 module? \u00b6 A: This module offers an emulated Hayes-compatible modem (on COM2), and talks to your WiFi network. This means you can connect to BBSes on telnet (there are still many out there!) the old skool way, or even connect to the internet on Windows 98 using dial-up networking! Q: How do I connect a keyboard and mouse? \u00b6 A: You can choose whether to use real PS/2 keyboards/mice or modern USB variants. Configured by jumpers. (See Jumpers for more information.) Q: What's the sound card on this board? \u00b6 A: It's the Crystal Semi / Cirrus Logic CS4237B - which is a Sound Blaster Pro 2 / Windows Sound System compatible chip, working great in both DOS and Windows. It has a very good built-in Adlib/OPL3 FM synth as well, a powerful mixer for various input sources, and can output both analog line-level audio and digital audio (S/PDIF) using a TOSLink optical transmitter connector. Q: What's the point of the internal OPL3 header receptacle? \u00b6 A: While the CS4237B's emulated OPL3 synth is quite respectable, it's not a perfect 1:1 implementation of the Yamaha YMF262 (OPL3). This is where the OPL3 module comes into play. By plugging in such a module, you get the actual authentic OPL3 hardware using real Yamaha chips. Sound-wise, it's a subtle difference, but it's there. Q: What are my options for audio input/output? \u00b6 A: For output you have analog (line-level) and digital (S/PDIF) audio. Inputs are microphone (with a built-in pre-amp), line-in and analog CD audio. Line-in can be set (using jumpers) to either the external 3.5mm jack (for external MIDI synthesizers, for example), or internal - from a wavetable plugin card or a software-based MT-32 or MIDI synth on a Raspberry Pi. Q: What kind of internal synthesizers can I use? \u00b6 A: There are three internal synth connectors on the board. The first is the 26-pin wavetable connector. Here you can plug in MIDI wavetable cards such as the X2, X2GS, X16, X16GS, etc. from Serdashop - these are modern cards using the Dream chipset and uses soundfonts to replicate various MIDI synthesizers. You've also got two 40-pin connectors for plugging in a Raspberry Pi. Either use the male header with a 40-pin female-female ribbon cable to connect a standard Pi 3 or 4, or you can plug a Pi Zero 2's pins directly into the female connector. Since the Raspberry Pis are full computers in their own sense, they can run all kinds of software synthesizers and output digital I2S audio to the motherboard. There's a PCM5102 DAC on the board to convert the audio to analog, and then feed it into the Crystal sound chip. The easiest way to get a Pi up and running as a synth is to use the mt32-pi software which requires minimal effort. It'll do MT-32 using the munt emulator, and General MIDI using the Fluidsynth application with soundfonts. If you're adventurous and have a Pi 4, you can also run the SC-55 emulator nuked-sc55 on a regular Debian installation, for an extremely accurate Roland SC-55 sound. (See MIDI for more information.) Q: What about the game port connector? \u00b6 A: The game port connector offers limited joystick/gamepad support through the Crystal sound card. In addition, you have MIDI input and output, so you can connect an external synth (like the Roland MT-32 or SC-55) using a standard gameport-to-MIDI breakout cable. See GamePort Limitation for more information. Q: What's the AGP compatibility of the ITX-Llama? \u00b6 A: The mechanical/electrical connector on the board is 3.3V-keyed. That means AGP cards with the 3.3V-notch (towards the VGA connector-side of the card) as well as \"universal\" cards with two notches will fit and run. 1.5V-keyed cards with only the notch towards the opposite side of the VGA connector will neither fit nor be compatible with the motherboard's 3.3V-signal level. From a protocol perspective, this is AGP 1x, with some caveats. A quite technical summary; there is no native AGP support on the Vortex86EX, only PCI Express x1 (gen 1). This is converted to PCI at 66 MHz by an onboard PI7C9X118 chip. Since AGP is really only PCI running at a higher clock frequency (66 vs 33 MHz), this is fine. However, AGP supports additional features not found on PCI, like split transactions, sideband addressing and GART. What this means is that AGP cards where the Windows driver requires one or more of these AGP-only features will not work properly. In practice, most older cards should work just fine and are probably a better fit for the CPU's speed as well. Of note is the Radeon 9200 / 9250, as well as the Voodoo3 - these have been tested extensively and found to be a very good match. Q: Does the board have front panel connectors? \u00b6 A: Yes, power button, reset button, power LED and SD card activity LED. Q: Does the board have a PC speaker? \u00b6 A: Yes, an internal one (with two volume settings, configured by jumper), and a pin header for connecting an external speaker. Q: Which operating systems are supported? \u00b6 A: MS-DOS, FreeDOS and early Windows (3.1, 95, 98). Q: Which storage devices can be booted from and run an operating system? \u00b6 A: All of them; microSD, USB and SATA. Q: My question isn't listed here, where can I learn more? \u00b6 A: Try asking in the ITX-Llama thread on the Vogons forum , or join the Discord server .","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"itxllama/faq/#itx-llama-faqs","text":"","title":"ITX-Llama - FAQs"},{"location":"itxllama/faq/#q-what-do-i-need-in-addition-to-the-itx-llama-board","text":"A: You'll need: The Vortex86EX system-on-module (SOM).

Sound-wise, it's a subtle difference, but it's there.","title":"Q: What's the point of the internal OPL3 header receptacle?"},{"location":"itxllama/faq/#q-what-are-my-options-for-audio-inputoutput","text":"A: For output you have analog (line-level) and digital (S/PDIF) audio. Inputs are microphone (with a built-in pre-amp), line-in and analog CD audio. Line-in can be set (using jumpers) to either the external 3.5mm jack (for external MIDI synthesizers, for example), or internal - from a wavetable plugin card or a software-based MT-32 or MIDI synth on a Raspberry Pi.","title":"Q: What are my options for audio input/output?"},{"location":"itxllama/faq/#q-what-kind-of-internal-synthesizers-can-i-use","text":"A: There are three internal synth connectors on the board. The first is the 26-pin wavetable connector. Here you can plug in MIDI wavetable cards such as the X2, X2GS, X16, X16GS, etc. from Serdashop - these are modern cards using the Dream chipset and uses soundfonts to replicate various MIDI synthesizers. You've also got two 40-pin connectors for plugging in a Raspberry Pi. Either use the male header with a 40-pin female-female ribbon cable to connect a standard Pi 3 or 4, or you can plug a Pi Zero 2's pins directly into the female connector. Since the Raspberry Pis are full computers in their own sense, they can run all kinds of software synthesizers and output digital I2S audio to the motherboard. There's a PCM5102 DAC on the board to convert the audio to analog, and then feed it into the Crystal sound chip. The easiest way to get a Pi up and running as a synth is to use the mt32-pi software which requires minimal effort. It'll do MT-32 using the munt emulator, and General MIDI using the Fluidsynth application with soundfonts. If you're adventurous and have a Pi 4, you can also run the SC-55 emulator nuked-sc55 on a regular Debian installation, for an extremely accurate Roland SC-55 sound. (See MIDI for more information.)","title":"Q: What kind of internal synthesizers can I use?"},{"location":"itxllama/faq/#q-what-about-the-game-port-connector","text":"A: The game port connector offers limited joystick/gamepad support through the Crystal sound card. In addition, you have MIDI input and output, so you can connect an external synth (like the Roland MT-32 or SC-55) using a standard gameport-to-MIDI breakout cable. See GamePort Limitation for more information.","title":"Q: What about the game port connector?"},{"location":"itxllama/faq/#q-whats-the-agp-compatibility-of-the-itx-llama","text":"A: The mechanical/electrical connector on the board is 3.3V-keyed. That means AGP cards with the 3.3V-notch (towards the VGA connector-side of the card) as well as \"universal\" cards with two notches will fit and run. 1.5V-keyed cards with only the notch towards the opposite side of the VGA connector will neither fit nor be compatible with the motherboard's 3.3V-signal level. From a protocol perspective, this is AGP 1x, with some caveats. A quite technical summary; there is no native AGP support on the Vortex86EX, only PCI Express x1 (gen 1). This is converted to PCI at 66 MHz by an onboard PI7C9X118 chip. Since AGP is really only PCI running at a higher clock frequency (66 vs 33 MHz), this is fine. However, AGP supports additional features not found on PCI, like split transactions, sideband addressing and GART. What this means is that AGP cards where the Windows driver requires one or more of these AGP-only features will not work properly. In practice, most older cards should work just fine and are probably a better fit for the CPU's speed as well. Of note is the Radeon 9200 / 9250, as well as the Voodoo3 - these have been tested extensively and found to be a very good match.","title":"Q: What's the AGP compatibility of the ITX-Llama?"},{"location":"itxllama/faq/#q-does-the-board-have-front-panel-connectors","text":"A: Yes, power button, reset button, power LED and SD card activity LED.","title":"Q: Does the board have front panel connectors?"},{"location":"itxllama/faq/#q-does-the-board-have-a-pc-speaker","text":"A: Yes, an internal one (with two volume settings, configured by jumper), and a pin header for connecting an external speaker.","title":"Q: Does the board have a PC speaker?"},{"location":"itxllama/faq/#q-which-operating-systems-are-supported","text":"A: MS-DOS, FreeDOS and early Windows (3.1, 95, 98).","title":"Q: Which operating systems are supported?"},{"location":"itxllama/faq/#q-which-storage-devices-can-be-booted-from-and-run-an-operating-system","text":"A: All of them; microSD, USB and SATA.","title":"Q: Which storage devices can be booted from and run an operating system?"},{"location":"itxllama/faq/#q-my-question-isnt-listed-here-where-can-i-learn-more","text":"A: Try asking in the ITX-Llama thread on the Vogons forum , or join the Discord server .","title":"Q: My question isn't listed here, where can I learn more?"},{"location":"itxllama/getting-started/","text":"Getting Started with your ITX-Llama \u00b6 Congratulations!

Below is a breakdown of each option and several add-ons that are compatible. OPL-3 FM Synthesis Support \u00b6 Out of the box, the Crystal CS4237B sound chip can emulate OPL-3 through its Crystal FM synthesis engine. This is a close approximation to a genuine Yamaha OPL-3 for most titles but has been known to fall short in certain cases. The ITX Llama offers an OPL-3 header which accepts a custom OPL-3 board containing an old-stock Yamaha YMF262-M FM synth chip. This will provide a genuine Yamaha OPL-3 sound for games utilizing FM Synthesis. Roland MT-32 Support \u00b6 Raspberry Pi Zero 2 \u00b6 A Raspberry Pi Zero 2 is capability of emulating a Roland MT-32 using the excellent Munt emulator. To facilitate this as a drop-in feature, the mt32-pi project adds this functionality to a simple Pi Zero 2 and installed directly onto the ITX Llama. Audio is passed through an onboard DAC to the Crystal's Line In. Pros: provides a near perfect emulation of the Roland MT-32 / CM-32L (Intelligent Mode does require SoftMPU) audio is routed through an onboard DAC to the Crystal sound chip via i2c preventing the need for additional hardware besides the Pi Zero 2 itself and an SD card. Additional features: mt32-pi supports General MIDI using the FluidSynth engine and user-supplied sound fonts. ITX Llama users could technically employ just the Pi Zero 2 with mt32-pi in addition to the OPL-3 module to cover nearly all bases of MIDI in early DOS games. Installation: Raspberry Pi 4 \u00b6 A Raspberry Pi 4 can also be attached in lieu of the Pi Zero 2. This is a much more advanced option but opens the possibility of running a full OS with Munt, FluidSynth and a modified version of the nuked-SC-55 emulator for genuine Roland SC-55 sound support. A 40pin ribbon cable such as an old IDE cable affixed to the pins on board below and to the Raspberry Pi 4 is necessary to use this feature. At this time, system setup for the Pi 4's OS is an advanced topic that is left up to the user to tinker with. Pin Header: ( below the female Pi Zero 2 header ) mt32pi Hardware UI \u00b6 There are a set of headers that allow connecting the an mt32pi Hardware UI (OLED, 4 buttons, optional rotary encoder). This header is connected to the correct GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi headers to simplify adding a control mechanism. The header uses the following pins, which are wired one-to-one to an i2c OLED display: more info SDA (data), SCL (clock), 3v3 (VCC), GND (ground) Most OLED displays that specify i2c connections use these four pins. The remaining pins are designed for either buttons or a rotary encoder. more info B1 and B2 are \"buttons\" which control the Synth mode and ROM/Soundfont selection B3 and B4 can either be \"buttons\" or a rotary encoder. These control the output volume of the synth engine. A rotary encoder can be connected as follows: B3 --> DAT B4--> CLK GN~D-->GND Wavetable MIDI Support \u00b6 The ITX Llama contains a Wavetable compatible header as well. This can be configured with a variety of Wavetable Synth modules to provide General MIDI support through the Crystal sound chip. This header can be enabled via Jumpers: J25, J26, J27 For using a Raspberry Pi (Zero2, 3 or 4) for converting MIDI to analog audio, place the three jumpers to the rightmost position (\"PI\"). For using a wavetable board, place the jumpers to the leftmost position (\"WT\"). NOTE: In Rev. F, the J27 \"Power\" jumper was removed.

Below details the remediation steps to restore stereo In/Out on the Blue and Green 3.5mm jacks. Tool Recommendations: \u00b6 X-Acto Precision Utility Knife, Metal Benchtop Drill Press with 7-Speed CNC 795 Motor,flexible Soft Shaft Function,JTO Chuck for Precision Drilling 1mm drill bits: HARFINGTON 25pcs Micro Jobber Twist Drill Bits #59 1mm / 0.0394\" Optional: Pin vice: Mulwark Precision Pin Vise Hand Drill Set 25 Pcs Optional: AM ARROWMAX Mini Electric Engraving Pen, 36 Bits With Aluminum Case A multimeter with \"beep\" continuity test: Example: UNI-T UT210e Digital Clamp Meter Jig / brace for ITX-Llama board (TBD if this really is needed) Steps for fixing the External Analog Line-In Jack: \u00b6 Place ITX-Llama upside down on a jig (if available), brace or vice Identify the audio connector pins from underneath Ensure the ITX-Llama is reasonably stable by pushing on the bottom of the audio connector. The board should not move. Identify the Line-In pins Plug any 3.5mm cable into the blue Line-In jack (this creates the short) Test continuity between the two identified Line-In pins Using either the engraving pen with an abrasive tip OR an Xacto knife, break the trace visible between the two identified pins. An engraving pen should sand/wear away the trace without digging too deep into the board. (This will cause less wrist strain as well) An Xacto knife should be able to cut the trace by scratching it with medium pressure. Do not gouge the board too deep! It should look like this: Test continuity again between the two identified Line-In pins. If the drill was successful, there should not be any continuity. Repeat Steps 6 and 7 until the meter stops beeping, indicating continuity is broken. Congratulations, you have restored stereo to the External Analog Line-In Jack. Steps for fixing the External Analog Line-Out Jack: \u00b6 Setup: (one-time, recheck as necessary) \u00b6 Assumptions: You have already unpacked and set up the drill press You have loaded a 1mm drill bit into the drill press Place ITX-Llama upside down on a jig (if available), brace or vice and clamp it to a drill press. Identify the audio connector pins from underneath Plug any 3.5mm cable into the green Line-Out jack (this creates the short) Ensure the ITX-Llama is reasonably stable by pushing on the bottom of the audio connector. The board should not move. Set the drill press table to it's lowest depth setting (or drill motor to its highest/tallest setting) Try a test plunge NEXT to a ITX-Llama board resting upside down on its jig. The drill press should stop before the tip extends past the board. If the tip still plunges past the board, try adjusting the travel depth or limit screws until the bit does not pass through the board. Once the bit is not passing through the depth of the board in its jig, carefully begin to adjust the depth so that the tip plunges just past the board (about 1mm, use a spare 1mm drill bit for comparison) . Make several test plunges all the way to until plunge stops at the limits and check that the bit isn't too deep each time. This is to verify that settings aren't drifting between each plunge. Drill: (repeat for each board) \u00b6 Place ITX-Llama upside down on a jig (if available), brace or vice and ensure it is reasonably stable and clamp it to a drill press table. Identify the Line-Out pins Test continuity between the two identified Line-Out pins With the drill OFF , test plunging the drill and ensure the bit tip lands directly over the correct spot. Adjust the position of the ITX-Llama and/or fence clamps until the bit touches the right spot on each plunge. This should be a one-time operation if using a solid jig for the ITX-Llama to rest in. Once satisfied that the drill press plunges into the correct spot and the board is secure, turn ON the drill and make your hole.

Set the drill press table to it's lowest depth setting (or drill motor to its highest/tallest setting) Try a test plunge NEXT to a ITX-Llama board resting upside down on its jig. The drill press should stop before the tip extends past the board. If the tip still plunges past the board, try adjusting the travel depth or limit screws until the bit does not pass through the board. Once the bit is not passing through the depth of the board in its jig, carefully begin to adjust the depth so that the tip plunges just past the board (about 1mm, use a spare 1mm drill bit for comparison) . Make several test plunges all the way to until plunge stops at the limits and check that the bit isn't too deep each time.

Problem Description \u00b6 The GamePort on the ITX-Llama interfaces with the Crystal CS4372B sound chip. During the design, it was observed that Crystal shares pins with other functions and a decision was made to limit joystick support to 2 axis, 2 buttons (Joystick #1) so that other features could be enabled. The pins used to communicate with the External FM Synth and S/PDIF audio output are also used for Buttons #3 and #4 of \"Joystick #2\". _As an unintended consequence, it was discovered that the Crystal chip mirrors/ghosts the signal data reserved for S/PDIF and the External FM module onto Buttons #3 and #4 despite \"Joystick #2\" being disabled. Symptom \u00b6 Joystick tests show excessive activity on buttons #3 and #4. Games which use those buttons interact unexpectedly, skip cut scenes or behave erratically. Calibration and button reassignment is not possible as the erratic activity skips or assigns buttons incorrectly. Workaround \u00b6 Disable the GamePort by forcing a mismatch in the port assignment. In BIOS: Select Port 208h for the GamePort In Autoexec.bat: Ensure SET BLASTER has J200 at the end. This mismatch will effectively disable the GamePort in DOS and prevent erratic button presses from causing games to misbehave.","title":"Known Issue - GamePort functionality limitations"},{"location":"itxllama/issues/issue-gameport/#known-issue-gameport-functionality-limitations","text":"Batch #1 and #2 (thru Rev F) have some unintended limitations in functionality for the GamePort, particularly in MS-DOS.","title":"Known Issue - GamePort functionality limitations"},{"location":"itxllama/issues/issue-gameport/#problem-description","text":"The GamePort on the ITX-Llama interfaces with the Crystal CS4372B sound chip.
