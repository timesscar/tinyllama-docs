# Meet the TinyLlama family

Documentation for the TinyLlama family of retro inspired computers designed and built by [Eivind Bohler](https://github.com/eivindbohler). Each iteration is a variation on the following principles:

- Build A fully-fledged 486/Pentium-class PC in a tiny form factor
- Integrate Sound Blaster Pro-compatible audio
- Add a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 for Roland MT-32 and General MIDI music
- Open-source the hardware schematics, board layout and BIOS - build your own!
- Perfect for playing DOS games!
