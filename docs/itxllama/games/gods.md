# ITX Llama - Running GODS

[GODS][GODS-wikipedia] is particularly challenging because it requires a slow CPU and MPU-401 Intelligent Mode to run properly. This guide will hopefully help you get this running on your ITX Llama.

## Prerequisites
* MS-DOS or FreeDOS (FreeDOS v1.4 RC2+ has been confirmed to work well)
* EMS activated (2MB minimum)
* SoftMPU configured
* mt32pi selected for sound output, set to MT-32 mode and active
* "slowdown" utility. [(get it here)][tool-SLOWDOWN]

## Configuration

1. Run the following commands:
```
SOFTMPU.EXE /SB:220 /IRQ:7 /MPU:330
SLOWDOWN /P:50
GODS.EXE
```
1. When finished, run:
```
SLOWDOWN /U
```
