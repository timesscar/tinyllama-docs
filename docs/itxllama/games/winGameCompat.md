*All games were tested with a Voodoo 3 3000, and the SOM set to 500mhz, with a processor and case fan in place. It uses a bare bones windows 98 installation with [drivers from the ITX Llama github](https://github.com/eivindbohler/itxllama?tab=readme-ov-file#windows-98-drivers), then fully patched using http://v4.windowsupdaterestored.com, and the [voodoo 1.07 drivers](https://www.dosdays.co.uk/topics/Manufacturers/3dfx/3dfx_voodoo3_3000.php) installed (not affiliated, use at your own risk). Games were tested with any available introductory mission, using default detail settings and resolution. "Bad" indicates that the game will not load or is otherwise unplayable due to performace constraints. "Poor" indicates that the game is playable, but with poor framerate and likely requires low detail settings. "Good" means the game is playable without special considerations. Playable games may still benefit from adjustment of detail settings.*
